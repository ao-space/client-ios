## Requirements

Installation
==========================

### Installation with CocoaPods

YCEasyTool is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "YCEasyTool"
```

### Installation with Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate `YCEasyTool` into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "ungacy/YCEasyTool"
```

Run `carthage` to build the frameworks and drag the appropriate framework (`YCEasyTool.framework`) into your Xcode project according to your need. Make sure to add only one framework and not both.
